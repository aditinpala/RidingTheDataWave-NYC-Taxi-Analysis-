# New-York-City-Taxi-Analysis
I conducted analysis of New York City's taxi industry using Python, extracting insights from a vast dataset of 8M+ records. My project demonstrates expertise in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling, providing insights into industry's dynamics during COVID-19 pandemic.
Key Highlights:
1. Performed data cleaning and exploratory analysis on dataset of 8M+ records using NumPy and pandas, revealing trends in payment methods (cash vs. cashless) during COVID-19 pandemic.
2. Utilized seaborn and matplotlib library to create visualizations showcasing fluctuation of surge prices throughout the day and its impact on ride booking rates in New York City.
3. Built XGBoost regression model using scikit-learn library to predict congestion surcharge based on pickup, drop-off locations and ride booking density achieving means square error of 2.2 and root mean square error of 1.42.
